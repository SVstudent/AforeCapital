## 🌪️ The "Agentic" Breakthrough

View the Video here: https://youtu.be/yTS-J_T3SlU

Education is traditionally static. LuminaOS transforms it into a **Living Classroom** through **Multi-Agent Orchestration**. Unlike simple chatbots, LuminaOS deploys a fleet of specialized agents that collaborate autonomously via **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocols to research, visualize, and explain complex concepts in real-time.

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration Loop:**
1.  **Lead Tutor (ElevenLabs Conductor):** A low-latency conversational agent that speaks with the student and identifies learning gaps.
2.  **Lead Reasoning (MiniMax):** The brain that orchestrates delegation. It decides when to invoke specialists.
3.  **Research Agent (rtrvr.ai):** Autonomously searches the web for verified data, scientific papers, and real-time facts.
4.  **Visualization Agent (Runware + Canvas):** Instantly generates diagrams, illustrative assets, and mathematical proofs on an **Infinite Whiteboard**.
5.  **Transcription Engine (Speechmatics):** Provides medical-grade transcription for technical terms, building a live, accessible learning record.

## ✨ Features

### 🎙️ Conversational Mastery (ElevenLabs)
LuminaOS moves beyond "text-in-a-box." We use **ElevenLabs Conversational AI** to create a natural, voice-first tutoring experience. The Lead Tutor conducts the session purely through voice, using **Client Tools** to trigger visual updates on the student's screen without interrupting the flow of conversation.

### 🧠 Shared Neural Backbone (Convex)
Building a multi-agent system requires high-speed state synchronization. We use **Convex** as our **Shared Agent Memory**. When the Research Agent finds a new fact, it mutates the Convex state; the Visualist Agent immediately reacts to that state change to draw the concept, and the Lead Tutor "sees" the new data point to incorporate it into the speech—all within milliseconds.

### 🎨 Infinite Agentic Whiteboard
Our whiteboard isn't just a drawing tool; it's an agentic canvas.
- **Autonomous Placement:** Agents use **Gemini 2.0 Vision** and **A2A Logic** to discover free space on the board, ensuring new diagrams never overlap.
- **Visual Verification:** The Visualization Agent checks its own work, using Vision models to verify that the generated diagram correctly represents the scientific concept described.
- **Grounding & Reference:** Large-scale media generated by **Runware** is anchored to specific conversational timestamps, allowing students to "rewind" the board.

2. Launching LuminaOS
bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# Spin up the Convex backend
npx convex dev
# Run the local frontend
npm run dev
💡 Impact & Vision
LuminaOS democratizes the 2 Sigma Advantage. By providing every student with a conversational tutor that can research the world and visualize the abstract, we bridge the gap between static content and elite personal instruction.

This isn't an AI-assisted app—this is an Agent-Native future for education.
